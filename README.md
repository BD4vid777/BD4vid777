# Hi there, I'm here to develop some custom experiences
After 13 years managing various advertising projects and campaigns I decided to take a turn in my proffesional career. 
Iâ€™ve been always interested in new technologies and a natural direction was to become a web developer. 

I decided to focus on Frontend development with Angular as a primary framework.
