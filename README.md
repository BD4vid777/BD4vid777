### Hi there, I'm Dawid ðŸ‘‹

After 13 years managing various advertising projects and campaigns I decided to take a turn in my proffesional career. 
Iâ€™ve been always interested in new technologies and a natural direction was to become a web developer. 
After mastering a 1 year course as a Full Stack Developer I decided to focus on Frontend development with Angular as a primary framework. Iâ€™m still practicing and getting more knowledge, but I believe it is time to make a next move and start working as a developer and not only making some side projects.
